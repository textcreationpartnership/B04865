            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSITION For Remeding the Debaſement of COYNE IN SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>IT is evident that the Raiſing of the Denomination of the Standard of our Coyne above the Standard of <hi>England,</hi> by the Act of Parliament 1686. and what hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſaid Act, is not only expreſly contrair to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contract betwixt the two Kingdoms, <hi>Anno</hi> 16— but is in it ſelf one of the great Cauſes of the Nations Poverty; For, by it all our Goods are ſold at an unperceaved Undervalue: in ſo far, that we own and receave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown (and ſo every Species of their Money proportionably.) at <hi>5ſh.</hi> 5 <hi>d. ſterl.</hi> which is 8 ⅓ more than its Value in <hi>England,</hi> and when we give back that Crown to <hi>England,</hi> they will receave it only at <hi>5ſh.</hi> So we give our Goods for 8 ⅓ leſs than we are aware of; and when we Buy, we looſe 8 ⅓ of what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175027:4"/>Money we pay in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coyne. I Know it's thought that the Raiſing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will induce People to bring in many more of theſe Crowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than other wayes they would do; which is a Miſtake: For, any who was to bring in 13 of theſe Crowns, to Buy <hi>Scots</hi> Goods, if the Crown did paſs at <hi>5ſh. sterline,</hi> needs only now bring 12 of them; becauſe, the 5 <hi>d.</hi> rais'd on each one, makes up the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> And ſo it is evident it occaſions a fewer Number of Crowns to be imported. And if it be ſaid, that yet it invites People to bring more 12 Crowns, becauſe 12 gain 1 to them, and ſo it will occaſion more of our Goods to be bought. This Thought creeps in on men who do not examine things; for, 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The Evidence ſtill proves, that in Place of 13, there are but 12 imported. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> It proves, in Place of <hi>5ſh.</hi> &amp; 5 <hi>d.</hi> we get but real <hi>5ſh,</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The Merchand who needs our Goods will Buy what he needs, or ſo much of it as he knows of Mercat for, albeit his Crown were receaved at no more than <hi>5ſh.</hi> And albeit his Crown were taken at <hi>5ſh.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> He will buy no more than will anſwer his End, and ſuit his Mercat, 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> If Money be raiſed only to invite Merchands to buy greater Quantities of our Goods, we have an eaſier Medium for that End: <hi>viz.</hi> to Sell a Crowns worth at <hi>4ſh.</hi> &amp; 7 <hi>d.</hi> and ſo the Merchand has our Goods cheaper by 5 <hi>d.</hi> and by the rais'd Crown he hath no more. And as this is eaſier, ſo it is ſafer than the raiſing of Denominations, as will appear by the following other Miſchiefs of our raiſed Standard; <hi>viz,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The raiſing of Money, in one Species, hath naturalie obliged us to raiſe all other Coins proportionablie, not only our own, but all Forraign Coins; So that now, from whence ſoever Money is brought to buy our Goods, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175027:4"/>bring in 8 ⅓ leſs Money than they would bring in, were our Standard as formerlie. We alſo Sell all our Goods to every Nation or Perſon at 8 ⅓ leſs than they payed to us formerly, and whatever We buy from any forreign Place or People, we muſt add 8 ⅓ more of Money to buy it than we did formerly; For as was demonſtrat in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, ſo it is as plain in the ordinary Dollar, for who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly payed at 58 <hi>d. Sterl.</hi> in <hi>Croſs-Dollars</hi> or <hi>Patacoons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to give Us 2 <hi>d.</hi> to make up the 58 <hi>d:</hi> But now he payes Us 58. and keeps his 2 <hi>d.</hi> to himſelf. And in like manner, he who payed us 60 <hi>d.</hi> in <hi>Bank</hi> or ſome <hi>Imperial-Dollars,</hi> beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give Us a <hi>Bank-Dol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar,</hi> and 2 <hi>d.</hi> more, now he payes us 60 <hi>d.</hi> by the <hi>Dollar</hi> alone. and keeps the 2 <hi>d.</hi> So i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Ducatons,</hi> he who payed us 74 <hi>d.</hi> behoved to add 4 <hi>d.</hi> to make up 74 <hi>d.</hi> Now the bare <hi>Ducatons</hi> pays 74 <hi>d.</hi> and he Retains 4 <hi>d.</hi> to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as we loſs ſo much, by what the Importer of <hi>Money</hi> brings in, leſs than he would have done, had our <hi>Standard</hi> ſtood as it was formerly; ſo when ever we pay 58 <hi>d.</hi> to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner for his Goods, we muſt add 2 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Patacoon,</hi> to make up 58 <hi>d.</hi> When we pay 60 <hi>d.</hi> we muſt add 2 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Bank-Dollar.</hi> And when we pay 74 <hi>d.</hi> to a forreigner, we muſt add 4 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Ducatoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, we will raiſe the Price of our Native Goods in proportion to what we want by the <hi>Coyn.</hi> The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Argument will appear, if you Reflect, that in the firſt place, before we raiſe our Goods, we are cheated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their price riſe, and riſe from this cauſe; for if the price riſe by other cauſes as by the ſcarſity of our Goods in other places, or other emergent cauſes; then the forreigner behoved to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Money</hi> at the former <hi>Standart,</hi> and as much more alſo, as our Goods were more valued abroad, than formerly. But
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175027:5"/>this Solution refutes what was argued before for raiſing the <hi>Standard, viz.</hi> that of raiſing the Denomination people were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to import <hi>Money,</hi> for if he muſt ſtill pay as much <hi>Money</hi> as he did formerlie, what Invitation does He get, from rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Denomination?</p>
            <p>To what's thus argued againſt raiſing the of the <hi>Standart,</hi> add theſe yet more Weighty Arguments;</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Money</hi> gives no more abroad by our raiſing its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, So that <hi>Money</hi> imployed in Trade by <hi>Cambion,</hi> is in other places, eſpeciallie with all prudent Nations; The ſame it was, without any Alteration, by our raiſing it.</p>
            <p>So that, as leſs is brought in to us for our Goods, ſo we muſt ſend out the ſame in Value and more of our Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than we ſent out formerlie.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That <hi>Money</hi> is of no more uſe than dead uncoyned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> unleſs it be imployed in Merchandice, Trade or Cambion.</p>
            <p n="30">30. When I ſell my Eſtate at 20 Years purchaſe payed in new Denomination, in Order to Imploy it, as a Merchant or Bankier, when I Transfer it to theſe Uſes; my 100 is trulie, &amp; will prove to be, But 91 ⅔ and ſo much I have loſt of my Heritage. If I get 100 payed me of my Yearlie Rent, in the new Denomination; when <hi>I</hi> imploy this in Trade or Cambion, I ſhall find I have but 91 ⅔</p>
            <p n="40">40. The King, whatever he gets of his own Revenue, or new Taxes, Tho' he get 100 from the Subject, and what is trulie 100 out of the Subjects Eſtate, yet to any uſe for buying of foreign Goods or manageing of foreign Affairs, or paying his Forces by Sea or Land abroad, he gets but 91 ⅔</p>
            <p n="50">50. And which demonſtrats all the reſt, to all, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Trade, when I would have <hi>Money</hi> to do my buſineſs in Trade or otherwayes in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> or any where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175027:5"/>(But in <hi>Ireland,</hi> our Neigbours in Error, as well as in ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>I</hi> deſire <hi>Money, Ex. Gr.</hi> To be anſwered me at <hi>London, viz.</hi> 100 <hi>lib.</hi> The Bankier he tels me, this 100 <hi>lib.</hi> which you give me here, is ſhort of the Value of my <hi>Money</hi> at <hi>London</hi> 8 ⅓ of the 100, ſo I muſt pay in to him 108 ⅓ for 100 <hi>lib.</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and that beſide the Rate of <hi>Exchange,</hi> or other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to be hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>And it is the ſame thing, whether <hi>Money</hi> be raiſed in Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without altering, or debaſing the <hi>Standard,</hi> or to keep the former Denomination, and to give more Allay, and ſo to debaſe the Standart, or to give the ſame Denomination to a leſſer weight of the Coyne.</p>
            <p>Add yet to theſe Conſiderations, the ſad and ſenſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the ſtate of Money in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hath all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been diminiſhing, and the Nation deſcending inſenſibly toward Poverty, ſince that <hi>Aera</hi> of our Miſtake, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written Repreſentations to <hi>The Lords of the Articles</hi> in that Parliament, could prevent; nor printed Informations ſince, could redreſs, doth experimentaly evince to our ſhame and Hurt.</p>
            <p>And which (in the Propoſer's humble Opinion) is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to be redreſt, than by reſtoring our Money to the ſame Standard, in Weight and Fineneſs, with that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in place of many Arguments to perſwade this Remedy, the ſole Example of <hi>England</hi>'s uſeing the very ſame Cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the like Evil, lately to their Honour, Profit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their Generoſity and Prudence, whereby their ſtate hath eſcaped from Conſumption which ceded to no other cure. All the other Remedies of Banks, Loans and ſuch like Raggends of wit, were [as the wonderfull Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time did aptly name them] Monte-Bank
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175027:6"/>Recepts for State Evils: ſo that the Reputation of their Coin, the Credit of their Merchants, the true <hi>Par</hi> of their Exchange, the ſolidity of their eſtates both in Lands and Money, are eſtabliſht; and if after their Example, the Loſs be Rationally computed and impoſed on the Nation in general, it will prove to be our ſafty from greater Evils, as it hath been theirs: it were eaſy not only to Prove but to compute how much leſs everie one will pay of Ceſs impoſed for that end now when there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle real Caſh in the Nation, than they will Looſe if the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart continue in it's Lowneſs or rather in it's Over-value (which on the matter, ſignifies the ſame thing) and our Miſchiefs thereby increaſe.</p>
            <p>The other Conſideration and Propoſall for Remeiding of the ſwelling of our Exchange, and Conſequently the Ruine of all our Trade, by Import of Superfluities of many kinds; will appear more particularly in ſome other Propoſalls here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Here I ſhall only take notice, that by our buying more Superfluous goods in <hi>London, France, Holland</hi> and other places, than we ſend of Goods thither; it neceſſarly falls out, that our Merchants need more money there; than the Merchants of thoſe places do need Here; and therefore wee muſt pay more to them for money in any of theſe places, than they will give to us for money here; and that in proportion effiering to the different values, 'twixt what We Import from theſe Places and Fxport to them; which by the now current Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change at 15 <hi>per Cent:</hi> is vaſt; and enough ſhortly to drain our money altogether from us; for if a Merchant change his Money, Six or Seven times, it is evident, that he moſt Loſs ſix or ſeven times the Exchange; that is; the whole ſtock; and all that we can hope for ſupply, to this Waſt, is the little that our Highland Cows, Linnen, and ſome Salt, and
